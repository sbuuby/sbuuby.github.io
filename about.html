      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Replay Society was founded to preserve and revive the magic of analog media. In a world dominated by streaming and digitization, we believe in the experience – the rustle of packaging, the spin of reels, the drop of a needle onto vinyl. Our mission is to make these experiences accessible again – for rent, for purchase, or simply for inspiration.</p>

      <h2>Who We Are</h2>
      <p>We're a diverse crew of music lovers, film nostalgics, and retro gamers. Technically curious, detail-obsessed, and driven by a love for storytelling. What brings us together is the joy of analog – and the desire to share that joy with others.</p>
